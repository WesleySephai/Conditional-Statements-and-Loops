Conditional Statements and Loops

1. Create a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and calculates the factorial of that 
number using a loop.
2. Implement a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number n. The Fibonacci 
sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones as 
shown here- 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 19,…..and so on.
3. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a sentence and counts the occurrences of each letter 
in the sentence. Ignore case sensitivity.
4. Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and allows the user to guess 
the number. Provide feedback (greater or smaller) until the user guesses the correct number.
5. Implement a program that calculates the sum of all odd numbers between and including two given 
integers using a loop.
6. Write a function that takes a temperature in Celsius as input and returns a message indicating 
whether it's hot (> 30°C), warm (between 20°C annd 30°C), or cool (< 20°C).
7. Create a function that calculates the sum of all odd numbers between and including two given 
integers using a loop.
